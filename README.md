# Flipkart Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a static clone of the Flipkart homepage, built solely with *HTML* and *CSS*.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to replicate the visual layout and structure of a major e-commerce website using only fundamental web development languages. It serves as a showcase of my ability to structure a webpage using HTML and style it with CSS, including features like:

* Responsive header and navigation bar.
* Product listing sections with images and descriptions.
* A clean and modern layout that mimics the original site's design.

## Features

* *Header:* Includes a search bar, login buttons, and cart icons.
* *Navigation:* A full-width category navigation menu.
* *Product Displays:* Multiple sections for different product types (e.g., "Smart Phones," "Home Amenities").
* *Banners:* Prominent banners and advertisements styled to look like the live site.

## Technologies Used

* *HTML:* For the page structure and content.
* *CSS:* For all the styling, layout, and visual design.
